# 2023 Machine Learning Odyssey
- This repository stores the content used in a semester-long seminar "2023 Machine Learning Odyssey" (though held 2023-2024), led by [Seungeun Lee](https://duneag2.github.io/).
- These materials may not be perfectly accurate, as they reflect my thoughts on 'tabular data' and 'ML/DL for tabular data'.

|  No.  |  Description  |
|--------|--------------|
|  part1  | Why Tabular data?, Data preprocessing, Evaluation metrics, Cross validation, Missing values Imputation |
|  part2  | AutoML, Feature selection/extraction, Data Imbalance, Multicolinearity |
|  part3  | XGBoost part1 |
|  part4  | XGBoost part2 |
|  part5  | LightGBM |
|  part6  | Random Forest, TabNet |
|  part7  | Structured Query Language (SQL), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Hyperparameter Search (HyperOpt, TPE, Optuna) |
|  part8  | Final Remark (Transforming Tabular data to Images, Data Ecosystem (Reliable and Safe ML & Responsible MLOps through mathematical lens)), Recent advances in DL for Tabular data (FT-Transformer, TabPFN, Tunetables) |
